The vision of this app is to help dog lovers find a play date for their dogs by using an easy, efficient app. Many dog owners want to find a play date for their dog but don't know much people in their local area. This app is to fix that problem and help connect dog owners together in their local area. I was responsible for developing the match algorithm, including a the creation of a fictitious 'dog database' for users to match with. I also developed the local storage and match rendering for the application.",
